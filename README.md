This project uses [ActionBarSherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com/) for ActionBar compatibility. All this project does is creates an ActionBar, adds tabs to it, and implements a tab listener. As a note, tab scrolling works on ICS, or if the tabs fit into the ActionBar. On phones below (Honeycomb?) if the tabs appear in a separate row, they will not be scrollable. It is apparently a limitation of ActionBarSherlock 3.x, and as I wanted to demo doing this within the ActionBar, it seemed pointless to write a work-around using ViewPagers. I might look into doing that as another demo.
